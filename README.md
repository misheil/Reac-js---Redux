Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.  
(Not to be confused with a WordPress framework – [Redux Framework](https://reduxframework.com/).)

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools).

You can use Redux together with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), or with any other view library.  
It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).
